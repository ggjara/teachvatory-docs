                                                                                        The goal of teachvatory is to provide an easy visualization of students’
                                                                                      performance and quizzes’ answers.

                                                                                      ## Installation

                                                                                      - Clone respository branch `main`
                                                                                      - Copy `.secrets/` and `.Renviron` into the app’s main directory (you will need to ask the admin for these files)
                                                                                      - Install packages listed in `DESCRIPTION`

                                                                                      ## Run Locally

                                                                                      - Run `dev/run_dev.R` to launch the server

                                                                                      ## Editing app using GitHub workflow

                                                                                      1) Get GitHub branch name of the issue you want to solve (See options in [Linear](https://linear.app))
2) **Checkout** Standing on the app's directory, write on  terminal:
`git checkout -b [branch-name]`
The command `-b` allows you to create and move to the branch in one command.
3) Make all the changes you need to do
4) **Commit your changes:** On the terminal write:
`git commit -m "[A message to describe your change]"`
    * You can make as many commits as you want. A good approach would be to make a commit for every self-contained update.
5) **Push your changes:**  On the terminal write:
`git push origin [branch-name]`
6) Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ggjara/teachvatory) and make a `pull request` from your branch `[branch-name]` to `main`.
7) Admin will review your changes and merge the branch.
8) Once the branch is merged into `main` you can delete the branch remotely and locally.

## Publishing app on shinyapps.io

1) Be sure you are on the latest update of the `main` branch.
    * To update to the lastest update write on terminal:
    `git pull origin main`

2) Connect your account to your shinyapps.io account. Read more [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html).
3) You can publish the app using two methods:
    * Open `app.R` and press the Rsconnect publish button on the top right of RStudio.
    * Standing on the app's directory write on R:
  `rsconnect::deployApp()`


## Others

- You can access the terminal through any terminal shell or from [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co)
- You can interact with Git through the terminal (as described above) or through [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (which I highly recommend it)
